In this directory you will find all scripts to recreate analyses described in our paper.

**Intro**

Height is a very polygenic trait and well-studied in humans. GWAS summary statistics for height used hundreds of thousands of individuals of European ancestry. It is unclear how well polygenic risk scores (PRS) predict height in non-Europeans in comparison to Europeans. Here we explore and quantify this, and then provide improvements.

*outfiles: where Rds files and such are stores, not to be pushed to repo.
*figs: where figures are stores, not to be pushed to repo.
*input files: where modified input files are stored, not to be pushed to repo.
*scripts and READMEs: should be pushed to repo.


This will be updated as needed.
