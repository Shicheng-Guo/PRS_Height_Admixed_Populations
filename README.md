Intro

Height is a very polygenic trait and well-studied in humans. GWAS summary statistics for height used hundreds of thousands of individuals of European ancestry. It is unclear how well polygenic risk scores (PRS) predict height in non-Europeans in comparison to Europeans. Here we explore and quantify this, and then provide improvements.
